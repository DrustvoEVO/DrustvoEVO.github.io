- project: S3
  name: Summer School of Science S<sup>3</sup>/S<sup>3</sup>++
  description: The Summer School of Science is an international summer camp aimed at highly motivated high school students from Croatia and abroad. The School aims at promoting science among students and inspiring them to engage in studying natural science related subjects. The goal of the School is to provide students with hands-on scientific experience they cannot get in regular school education, to give them role models and promote international and intercultural understanding. Participation in the School gives talented high school students the opportunity to explore scientific ideas within the group of peers, mentors and renowned scientists. Around 50 students every year have an opportunity to obtain intense scientific training, while around 20 young scientists gain experience in education. Summer School of Science is comprised of two camps in total duration of 20 days.

- project: Zelena skola
  name: EVO Green School
  description: This project aims to introduce the solar energy to high school students, and ultimately turn participants’ schools into carbon neutral ones, by making a photovoltaic power plant which would meet the school’s power needs in its entirety. EVO Green School is highly interdisciplinary, as it includes the fields of physics, biology, chemistry, economics, electrotechnics, computer science, etc.

- project: internship
  name: EVO Internship Portal
  description: EVO Internship Portal was an online platform that helped Croatian university students to find and apply for internships in research laboratories across Europe. In addition to creating a platform, the goal was to offer direct help in writing internship and funding applications. EVO, as a third party, with its rich experience in similar programmes and numerous contacts inside the network of Summer School of Science alumni, served as a strong connection between students and laboratories interested in offering research opportunities, therefore contributing to their continuing education and development.

- project: szu
  name: Science meets arts workshop on BIODIVERSITY
  description: This workshop took place in Brela, Croatia, on August 25-31 2014. It was organized in collaboration with Prof Ivan Đikić (Goethe University, Frankfurt) and academic sculptor Ivanka Filipović as a part of Meeting Art Place (MAP) Brela 2014 Residence Program. It aimed at developing open-minded trans-disciplinary approach to public engagement of science among enthusiastic young artists and scientists. It facilitated combining artistic and scientific practice through projects where participants experimented with different types of creative expression. Together they came up with a unique improvised performance broadly themed up around the issue of biodiversity on our planet and exhibited artwork created during the workshop. Our hope was that such an activity may help to overcome artificial barriers between science and arts, provide inspiration for participants’ current activities and shed light on difficult global issues in the contemporary society. We also hoped to create positive effects on public awareness and support for sustainable development policies.

- project: SiS Catalyst
  name: SiS Catalyst
  description: Society for Out of Frame Education has been invited as one of the 36 organizations from 20 countries in “mentoring associates” part of FP7 project “SiS Catalyst”. The goal was to exchange experiences in science communication, education and social inclusion among different universities, museums and non-governmental organizations. Over 18 months, which was the time span of the project, the exchange of experience and knowledge took place, which aimed to serve as a platform for future good practice dissemination. Society for Out of Frame Education's partner organization was Paris-Montagne from France. 10 000 EUR obtained were spent towards the exchange of experience through visits of educators and participants between two associations.

- project: google
  name: Google RISE
  description: The educational project that arose from collaboration between the Summer Science Factory, Institute for Science and Society Synergy and Society for Out of Frame Education, has been awarded the prestigious Google RISE award (Roots In Science and Engineering). Competition was aimed at projects that encourage children to engage in "STEM" activities (STEM=science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The award was 15 000 $, which was used to open laboratories in Čakovec, Split and Zagreb, Croatia. The awarded amount will facilitate buying basic laboratory equipment, cover travel cost for mentors and students between cities and for organizing joint training seminars.

- project: extravaganza
  name: Happigenetics Extravaganza
  description: Happigenetics Extravaganza, an experiment in the communication of science and technology through performance art, was a collaboration between Society for Out of Frame Education, Science on Stage (Edinburgh, UK), Coaxil Band (St. Petersburg, Russia) and Sounds of Science (New York, USA). This all-ages interactive modern theatre piece was set to be performed on July 13th 2013 in St. Petersburg, Russia, in conjunction with the Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS) annual conference. The overarching goals of this project were to increase the public awareness of experimental biology and research culture, to celebrate the mystical aesthetics of the natural experimentation process, and to dissolve culturally constructed boundaries between scientific and artistic disciplines, which are often perceived as opposites.
